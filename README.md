fault-tolerant-benchmarks
=========================

Fault-tolerant distributed algorithms encoded in a formal language.
Now, we model fault-tolerant algorithms in parametric Promela, following
our Spin'13 paper:
 Annu John, Igor Konnov, Ulrich Schmid, Helmut Veith, Josef Widder.
 Towards Modeling and Model Checking Fault-Tolerant Distributed Algorithms.
 SPIN, volume 7976 of LNCS, pages 209-226, 2013.

Since SPIN'13 we have collected new benchmarks and extended them for
parameterized model checking with NuSMV and FAST. The benchmarks were
used to evaluate the techniques presented at SPIN'13, FMCAD'13, and CONCUR'14.

You can generate standard non-parameterized Promela code using our
tool ByMC: http://forsyte.tuwien.ac.at/software/bymc
